### Wednesday May 31st 6 P.M. @ ShiftKey Labs

Looking for tooling to bring your app to reality? Want to develop skills over the summer to prepare for Co-op? Learn
the basics of web applications? We got you covered!

Zero to Deploy: The Basics will introduce some of the tools used by some of the biggest start-ups such as Twitter, Shopify,
GitHub and Airbnb. We will dive into the concepts such as Model-View-Controller(MVC), continuous integration (CI) and
version control. We’ll learn these concepts by applying them during the workshop so you can see how it works first-hand.
Indeed, by then end of the workshop you will have a fully-functioning and hosted web application. Here are the tools
we’re going to use to achieve this: Ruby on Rails, GitHub and Heroku. The workshop is geared for first and second year
BCS/BACS students but we encourage anyone who wants to get an overview of modern web application development to join us.

To take full advantage of our time together, we recommend a small amount of preparation:
- Install Ruby on Rails: [step-by-step guide](http://installrails.com/)
- Create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/)
- Create a Heroku account: [here](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Optional] We recommend [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Rails development which you can get for free
with an [educational license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

Our team will be available before the workshop to help setting up your environment. After the workshop, we’ll post resources and tutorials so you can keep developing your skills after the workshop.

See you at ShiftKey!
