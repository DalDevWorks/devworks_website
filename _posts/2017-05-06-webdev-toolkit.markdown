DevWorks is about building a community of like-minded, driven, and motivated individuals outside of the traditional classroom. Conventional courses and traditional learning paradigms do not always give students the opportunity to think outside the box or to deploy their skillset in a way that directly reflects the challenges brought on by the marketplace. DevWorks is meant to empower Halifax STEM undergraduate students with the experience and tools to develop, innovate and compete on the global stage.
